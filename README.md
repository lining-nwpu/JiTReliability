1. [PROJECT_NAME]_input.csv:  Software changes, column "bug" indicates if a software change contains software defects. Each column represents:
    - transactionid: an index of each column
    - commitdate: the date when a software change is committed  
    - ns: The number of subsystems modified by a change
    - nm: The number of subdirectories modified by the change
    - nf: The number of files modified by the change
    - entropy: Distribution across the modified files
    - la: Lines of code added
    - ld: Lines of code deleted
    - lt: Lines of code in total
    - fix: whether a changes is a fix
    - ndev: Number of developers
    - pd: Average time gap to the last change over files
    - npt: Number of unique last changes to the files
    - exp: Developer experience, i.e. number of changes
    - rexp: Recent developer experience, i.e. weighted by ages
    - sexp: Developer experience over a subsystem
    - bug: whether a change contains software defects
    - data: commit date presented in number

2. [PROJECT_NAME]_input_EB.csv:
	Software changes, column "bug" indicates if a software change contains early exposed defects.
	
3. [PROJECT_NAME]_failures.csv: Software failures, each column represents:

    - create.date: The date when a defect as reported

4. [PROJECT_NAME]_commitsID.csv: Software changes index, each column represents
    - commit: Software change identifier
    - transactionid: The index of a software change

5. [PROJECT_NAME]_mapping.csv: Software change-defect mapping, each column represents
